## Project 1: Audio Amplifier

**Description:**  
whem I learnt about amplifiers in my class I was really eager to make an Audio amplifier so I descided To make audio amplifier.
It is not very much of a big project however i Taught me something crucial that " Dry soldering" can very much the sound.During my intials I was not able to figure out these problems later I understood how different is actual hardware from simulation.
**videos:**
